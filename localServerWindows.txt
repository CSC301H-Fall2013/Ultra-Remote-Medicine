This is what I, Andrew, did to get Django working with PostGres.

Assuming you have Django 1.5.4 installed.... [This is kind of important]
1. Google PostGres and download and run the installer.
	When it prompts for different settings, you can use whatever you'd like.
	Be sure to remember what password you provided, though.

2. Open up pgadmin.

3. On the tree view, navigate to Servers->PostGreSQL <<blah blah blah>>

4. Create a New Login Role by right clicking PostGreSQL <<blah blah blah>>, and clicking New Object->New Login Role

5. Set the user name of the new user to django_login and the password to 12345. Click OK

6. Navigate to Servers->PostGreSQL <<blah blah blah>>->Databases

7. Right click on the Databases node and click New Database

8. Set up the New Database with the following settings: Name: django_db, Owner: django_login

** These settings should all reflect the settings.py file in our project.

9. Try to runserver like usual.

If you get an exception like that a module can't be imported you should do the following:

Go to http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pip

1. Download/Install Setuptools and pip 

2. Ensure <<python 2.7 directory>/scripts is in your path

3. on the commandline, use: pip install <<whatever-it-says-is-missing>

4. Repeat (3) until nothing is missing
